# Types of Numbers

## 1. Natural Numbers (ℕ)
- Positive whole numbers starting from 1.
- Example: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...

## 2. Whole Numbers
- Natural numbers plus 0.
- Example: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...

## 3. Integers (ℤ)
- Whole numbers and their negatives.
- Example: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

## 4. Rational Numbers (ℚ)
- Numbers that can be written as a fraction (a/b), where a and b are integers, and b ≠ 0.
- Example: 1/2, -3/4, 5, -7, 0.75, 0, ...

## 5. Irrational Numbers
- Numbers that cannot be written as fractions; their decimal goes on forever without repeating.
- Example: π, √2, e.

## 6. Real Numbers (ℝ)
- All numbers that can be represented on the number line, including both rational and irrational numbers.
- Example: -2, 3, 1/2, √2, π, -5.6, ...

## 7. Imaginary Numbers
- Numbers that involve **i**, where **i = √-1**.
- Example: i, 3i, -4i, 2 + 5i, ...

## 8. Complex Numbers (ℂ)
- Numbers that have both a real part and an imaginary part.
- Written as **a + bi**.
- Example: 3 + 2i, -4 + 5i, 1 - 3i, ...

## 9. Algebraic Numbers
- Numbers that are roots of polynomial equations with integer coefficients.
- Example: 2, 3/4, √2, -√5.

## 10. Transcendental Numbers
- Numbers that are not algebraic (can't be roots of any polynomial with integer coefficients).
- Example: π, e.
